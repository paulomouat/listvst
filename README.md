# List VSTs

## Running from the IDE

The solution has configurations to run against the projects stored locally and in the NAS.

|       | Configuration            |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Local | `Html local user folder` |
| NAS   | `Html NAS folder`        |

The output of running the solution with one of these configurations is in file `o.html` in
the folder `ListVst\bin\Debug\net9.0\`. A link to this file is in the `Output`
solution folder.
